# BabyNames
It was a fun and straightforward exercise shared by InterviewQs.  They provided the dataset and requested writing a Python code to determine the top boy and girl names in 2009.

I mainly used Pandas library, the methods groupby, sort_values, unique, iloc, loc, and count.

In 2009, the girl and boy names with the most occurrences were Isabella and Jacob, respectively.
